      Soo, I made this site in <strong>2/06/2023</strong>, It's my first time making a site (<strong>that I'll actually try to maintain</strong>), I've made some sites before but I didnt really work on it, I just tested stuff.<br>
      <strong>I'll introduce myself: </strong> <br>
      I was born in the <strong>Philippines</strong> on <strong>May 18</strong>, I wont say my name or age for personal reasons, but I'm still a <strong>minor</strong> :)
<br>
      I'm familliar with <strong>Python, Javascript, Html, Css, a little bit of C++ and Java.</strong>
<br>
      <strong>My socials are:</strong>
